![Logo](/build/set.png)


Welcome to the official repository of the Deeeep.io Desktop Client!
> Currently the client is in beta, so some stuff will not be implemented yet

## What is this?

The D.D.C (Deeeep.io Desktop Client) is a free & opensource desktop application made with ElectronJS for the hit io game called [Deeeep.io](https://deeeep.io).

It has features like a built-in asset swapper, built-in extension store and detailed DiscordRPC!


## Testing
If you want to test this client(for developers who want to learn), you can install the entire thing in a zipped format

on GitHub, and unzip it and put in a folder, and open it in any IDE and run any of these scripts in the IDE:

Run `!INSTALL.cmd` to install all the node modules required to run the client

Run `!BUILD.cmd` to pack the client into a win-unpacked folder.

Run `!BUILD_EXE.cmd` to release the exe file of the client.

But before you do all of these, install NodeJS
